1.Check Safety: For each queen, check if placing it on a specific row and column is safe:
    Make sure no other queens are in the same column.
    Check the diagonals to ensure no queens are positioned there, as they would attack each other.
2.Solve with Backtracking:
    Start with an empty chessboard.
    Try to place a queen in each row, one by one:
        For each row, attempt to place the queen in each column.
        If itâ€™s safe, place the queen and move to the next row.
        If placing the queen leads to a solution, save it.
        If not, remove the queen and try the next column (backtracking).
        Repeat this process until you find all possible solutions.
3.Display Solutions:
    For each solution, print the board, showing queens as "Q" and empty spots as ".".
4.Run the Program:
    Ask the user for the number of queens.
    If the input is valid and greater than 3, run the backtracking solution.
    Print each solution or notify if none are found.
